## Context

Greenfield development of a modern backoffice web application intended to replace an existing Angular-based legacy system.

The application was designed as an internal operational tool to support administrative workflows, data management, and role-based access control.

---

## Role & setup

Senior Frontend Engineer (freelance), involved from initial architectural decisions through implementation and quality assurance.

Close collaboration with backend developers and stakeholders, with responsibility for frontend structure, tooling, and maintainability.

---

## Problem space

- Replacement of a legacy Angular application with a modern React-based architecture
- Need for a scalable and clearly structured component system
- Integration of authentication and authorization into the frontend layer
- High expectations regarding code quality, test coverage, and maintainability
- Requirement for efficient developer workflows in a growing codebase

---

## Key decisions & solutions

- Selection of Next.js as application framework to establish a clear project structure and build setup
- Definition of a scalable frontend architecture with explicit separation of concerns
- Introduction of a component-driven approach supported by internal design system patterns and Storybook
- Integration of authentication and authorization via Keycloak using OpenID Connect
- Setup of automated testing across unit, integration, and end-to-end levels
- Continuous attention to performance and rendering behavior during development

---

## Quality & collaboration

- Establishment and improvement of testing strategies using Jest, Vitest, Cypress, and Playwright
- Ongoing refactoring to keep the codebase clean and understandable
- Close coordination with backend teams to align API contracts and authentication flows
- Productive use of modern developer tooling, including AI-assisted workflows

---

## Constraints

The project was developed as an internal system without public access.
No screenshots or external links can be shared.

---

## Status / Outcome

Development progressed to a production-ready state.
The project was halted prior to rollout due to the client filing for insolvency.
