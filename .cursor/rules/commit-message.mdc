# Commit Message Format

Generate commit messages following the Conventional Commits format.

## Structure

`<type>: <subject>`

## Rules

- Max 150 characters total (including type prefix)
- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `docs`, `build`, `ci`
- Subject must not be empty
- Subject must not start with a capital letter (no sentence-case, start-case, or pascal-case)
- No period at the end
- Use imperative mood (e.g. "add", "rename", "fix" — not "added", "renamed", "fixed")
- Derive the type and subject from the staged diff
